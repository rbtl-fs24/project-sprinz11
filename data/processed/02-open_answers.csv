1,ETH Zurich,MSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,Make the information about where to find bins for separation more accessible. I do not find anything on the ETH website.
2,Other,MSc,Other,NA,That I am able to separate on the campus. I think that is not possible at my university.
5,ETH Zurich,MSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,"more aluminium can bins! please, cannot bother walking around campus with empty can after a drink. should be as common as PET collection points."
6,ETH Zurich,BSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,"Definitely more possibilities for cardboard and paper collection as well as glass. At least one known bin in each building but more preferably on each floor, especially for paper and cardboard. One known recycling area per campus where most to all of the options are available would be helpful for any less frequent waste materials since it would be easy to check out and find when one has something and is not sure whether there is an option at all. Alternatively there could be a recycling finder/map as there is for student printers online."
12,ETH Zurich,BSc,ETH Zentrum,No but my answers above are with respect to what waste I have. If I work in a lab and have metal or wood waste for example I would use these disposal options.,definitely add organic waste bins (like on the Hönggerberg)
13,ETH Zurich,MSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,less waste production and less combined materials
22,Other,MSc,Other,No,Adding pictures to the waste bins to give visual clues on how to separate the waste.
36,ETH Zurich,MSc,ETH Zentrum,No,NA
37,ETH Zurich,BSc,ETH Zentrum,Filament pla pegt abs asa,"Please don’t use the annoying sbb trashcan which close and you have push open with your hand to put something in, this makes me not want to separate waste and just trow it all in a open bin"
41,ETH Zurich,BSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,"Some waste bins have a spring-loaded lid that has to be pushed inward to be opened. Often people push on the lid with the trash they want to discard because they don‘t want to touch it. This can leave dirt on the lid, leading to even more people doing the same thing. It‘s highly unhygienic. These bins could be massively improved by attaching some kind of handle to the lid near its hinged edge. It is a very cheap and easy fix, and I have already seen it implemented on a waste bin in a burger king that had the same kind of lid."
42,ETH Zurich,MSc,ETH Zentrum,NA,A note on some bins where the nearest collection point is for less common waste e.g. like the one in HG D floor
