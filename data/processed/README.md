## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: The behavior and knowledge of Zurich's students regarding waste separation was examined by the utilization of a survey (Link to survey: https://forms.gle/P4ncgdWujPUFnryU9). This survey was then distributed in Whatsapp group chats, among friends, as well as random students on the campus. It contained demographic data, like the respondent's main institution, their main campus, and level of studies. Furthermore, for many different waste types, multiple choice questions determined the student's knowledge about their location and their need for such, as well as how far they would be willing to walk to dispose their waste in the designated bin for separation (produced during the time on campus) from the location it is produced before disposing it in the residual waste instead. All mentioned waste types are already available on campus for separation.

3.  Methods for processing the data: The data processing was done using an R script with the packages tidyverse and googlesheets4.

4.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: The data type .rds is specific to the tidyverse package. For people who do not have access to this, the identical data has been included as .csv files.
