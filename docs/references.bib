  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Report (including the SDG Index \& Dashboards) is a complement to the official SDG indicators and voluntary country-led review processes. The report is not an official monitoring tool. It uses publicly available data published by official data providers (World Bank, WHO, ILO, others) and other organizations including research centers and non-governmental organizations. Interest in the global SDG Index and Dashboards has spurred many initiatives to develop localized assessments of SDG progress.},
