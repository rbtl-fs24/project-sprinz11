# You will use the data_cleaning.R file to process your data into a state that
# is ready for analysis. Do not access the data from Google Drive, but rather
# use the read_csv() function to access your data from the data/raw folder. Save
# the processed, analysis-ready data in the data/processed folder using the
# write_csv() function. Again, give the file a meaningful name that describes
# your project.
